## Introduction
The housing market in Brazil presents unique characteristics, with various types of housing units and occupancy patterns. This project aims to explore and analyze housing data from Brazil to understand regional differences and trends in the real estate market.

## Data Preparation
- Two datasets, `brasil-real-estate-1.csv` and `brasil-real-estate-2.csv`, were imported and cleaned.
- Data cleaning steps included handling missing values, converting data types, and creating new columns for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualizations were created to explore the geographic distribution of properties in Brazil using scatter maps and to understand the distribution of home prices and sizes through histograms and box plots.
- Regional differences in mean home prices were analyzed using bar charts.

## Focus on the Southern Region
- The analysis was focused on the Southern region of Brazil, specifically Rio Grande do Sul.
- Relationships between home size and price were examined through scatter plots, providing insights into the real estate market dynamics in the region.
