 **Housing in Brazil is characterized by:**
1. More than 80% of all housing units are detached houses of brick, stone, wood or concrete.
2. Less than 10% of all housing units are apartments.
3. Less than 10% of all housing units are rural dwellings of wood or clay.
4. Less than 5% of all housing units are semi-private units called "quartes."
5. Roughly 74% of all dwellings are owner occupied (1998 est.).

## Introduction
The "Housing in Brazil" project is a comprehensive exploration and analysis of the real estate market in Brazil. Brazil's housing market is characterized by diverse housing units and occupancy patterns, reflecting the country's cultural and economic landscape. This project delves into various aspects of the Brazilian housing market, including regional differences, housing types, price trends, and geographic distribution.

## Key Objectives
1. **Data Collection and Cleaning:** The project begins with the collection and cleaning of housing data from multiple sources, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Through exploratory data analysis techniques, the project aims to uncover insights into the Brazilian housing market, including the distribution of housing types, price variations, and regional patterns.
3. **Geospatial Analysis:** Utilizing geospatial visualization techniques, the project maps the geographic distribution of properties across different regions of Brazil, providing a visual representation of housing trends.
4. **Regional Analysis:** The project conducts in-depth analyses of specific regions within Brazil, such as the Southern region, to understand localized housing dynamics and market trends.
5. **Visualization and Communication:** The findings of the analysis are communicated through various visualization techniques, including scatter plots, histograms, box plots, and bar charts, facilitating easy interpretation and understanding.

## Expected Outcomes
- Insights into regional variations in the Brazilian housing market.
- Understanding of housing types and occupancy patterns in Brazil.
- Identification of factors influencing housing prices and market trends.
- Geospatial visualization of housing distribution across different regions.
- Data-driven recommendations for stakeholders in the Brazilian real estate sector.

## Significance
Understanding the dynamics of the housing market is crucial for policymakers, real estate developers, investors, and homeowners. This project provides valuable insights and actionable recommendations to stakeholders involved in the Brazilian real estate industry, contributing to informed decision-making and strategic planning.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python programming language
- Data analysis libraries: Pandas, NumPy
- Data visualization libraries: Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn
- Geospatial analysis tools: GeoPandas, Folium

## Data Preparation
- Two datasets, `brasil-real-estate-1.csv` and `brasil-real-estate-2.csv`, were imported and cleaned.
- Data cleaning steps included handling missing values, converting data types, and creating new columns for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualizations were created to explore the geographic distribution of properties in Brazil using scatter maps and to understand the distribution of home prices and sizes through histograms and box plots.
- Regional differences in mean home prices were analyzed using bar charts.

## Focus on the Southern Region
- The analysis was focused on the Southern region of Brazil, specifically Rio Grande do Sul.
- Relationships between home size and price were examined through scatter plots, providing insights into the real estate market dynamics in the region.

## Conclusion
The project offers valuable insights into the housing market in Brazil, highlighting regional variations and trends. Further analysis and modeling could provide deeper insights into factors influencing home prices and market dynamics.
